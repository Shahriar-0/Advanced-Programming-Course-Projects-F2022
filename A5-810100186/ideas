first write the variables not the methods
add things step by step


---------------------------------------------
obviously a class for handling the whole game with a name like star wars
a class for my ship (for now i decided to keep all the bullets of a ship inside of it
it means that there should be a vector of corresponding bullet in each ship, the thing 
to remember is that the bullets that are already shot should still be moving)
a class for hostage
a class for stationary enemy
a class for moving enemy
a class for stationary enemy team
a class for moving enemy team
and the above two teams should be passed as an 
pointer to the bullets ( inheritance ) for checking
hit
for choosing who should shoot maybe get their alive ships
and then choose an arbitrary number of them
a class for my bullets (the thing for now is to keep the pointer of the vector
which holds the list of all enemies and also the hostage and then i got to check all of them in 
each frame)
a class for enemy bullet (sth like the last one but holds only my ship)
