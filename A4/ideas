#the_scheme_of_game
get num of rounds


initialising (delete all the guns except knife, set health to 100)

do the starting menu {
    add-user (<username> <terrorist|counter-terrorist) "ok"
    get-money (<username>)  "<money>"
    get-health (<username>)     "<health>"
    go-afk or go-atk(<username>) "ok"
    buy (<username> <weapon-name>)
         if no error encountered (see #4 in things to remember)   "weapon bought successfully"
    score-board () "list of every users based on things listed in #5 of things to remember"
    start () "The game hasn't started yet"
}


game (which will be run when the "start" command is entered in the start menu, greeted with "fight!") {
    get-money (<username>)  "<money>"
    get-health (<username>)     "<health>"
    go-afk or go-atk(<username>) "ok"
    shoot (<attacker> <attacked> <heavy|pistol|knife>)
        if no error encountered (see #6 in things to remember) "nice shot"
}

check for endgames (if counter-strike has at least one member they are the winner) {
    add money win 2700, lose 2400
    show result either "terrorist won" or "counter-terrorist won"
}



#things_to_remember
1. there's a 10,000 limit on player money
2. buy and add-user are forbidden during game 
3. cannot shoot in AFK mode
4. errors in buy [
    1- if AFK or not signed up -> "user not available"
    2- if after start -> "you can't buy weapons anymore"
    3- if that gun does not exists -> "weapon not available"
    4- if already have it -> "you already have this weapon" (knife is always there and you cannot buy it)
    5- if not enough money -> "insufficient money"
]
5. how to sort for score-board [
    1- kills more
    2- if kills equal then deaths less
    3- if both kils and deaths equal then name
]
6. errors in shoot [
    1- if AFK or not signed up -> "user not available"
    2- if the attacker or attacked is already dead (note: that it should be dead before shot obviously)
        either "attacker is dead" or "attacked is dead"
    3- if you have not purchased this weapon -> "attacker doesn' have this gun"
    4- if they both are on the same team -> "you can't shoot this player" (note: dont reduce health)
]


#the_general_ideas
there should be a class for gun {
    price and damage and prize(dunno name yet)
} and there should be probably some global constexpr for heavy and pistol and knife

there should be a class for player {
    username
    list of guns
    money
    health
    mode -AFK OR ATK-
    shoot ()
    buy ()
    go AFK or ATK ()
    getters for health and money and probably list of guns 
}
there should be a class for team {
    list of players
    name 
    add user ()
}

for score board probably pass refrence to the teams and then put all players refrences in a vector and 
then sort based on #5 in things to remeber
